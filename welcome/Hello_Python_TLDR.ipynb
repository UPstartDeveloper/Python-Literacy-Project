        "\n",
        "### Numeric Types\n",
        "Numbers are everywhere! In Python, we have 3 kinds of data types to represent numerical data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `int` - whole numbers \n",
        "- `float` - floating-point (aka fractional) numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "Between the `int` and `float` types, Python 3 lets you store any kind of real number in a variable. \n",
        "\n",

        "- an `int`, if 1) both operands are integers AND 2) it is not the division (`/`) operator\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Order of Operations\n",
        "Python prioritzes some operations over others. This means that it follows a *precedence order* that decides which operation to compute first, when there are several of them together in a given expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "The operators in Table 2 are listed from **highest** to **lowest** precedence, for your reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next data type we will cover are strings, which are also known as a *text sequence type*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strings\n",
        "Strings in Python are used to represent any sequence of characters. Basically, anything that can be typed on a computer between a pair of quotes is a string!\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Common String Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **String concatenation**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    *Concatenation* is when one string is added onto the end of another string. A quick and easy way to do this is by using the addition (`+`) operator, just like we did for numbers!\n",
        "\n",
        "    For example, let's say we wanted a string that said `'Alice met Allison on Tuesday'` - then the code could look like the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    'Alice met ' + 'Allison on Tuesday'\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    **Note**: although using addition works, it is far from perfect. In practice we prefer 1) *string formatting*, which will be discussed later in this book, or 2) the `str.join()` function, which you may read about in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#str.join).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **String Replication**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    *Replication* is when we repeat a given string over and over again in a new, longer `str` object. \n",
        "    \n",
        "    Incidently, Python makes this easier for us through the `*` operator. \n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    'Alice' * 5\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Displaying Messages using `print()`**\n",
        "    You will most often see strings where a program needs to tell the user some kind of message - this is exactly what the `print()` function will do:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    print('Hello world!')\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Gathering User Responses using `input()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "    Another common task is for a computer program to ask the user for their information - this can be done in Python via the `input()` function. \n",
        "\n",
        "    Consider the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    name = input('What is your name?') # ask for their name\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    The user will first be prompted to enter their name, and then their response is captured in the variable called `name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Measuring Length using `len()`**\n",
        "\n",
        "    We can also calculate the number of characters in a string:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    len('hello')  # result: 5\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    The `len()` function is also applicable to all of Python's \"container\" data types, which are used to store multiple pieces of data at the same time (like lists, sets, and dictionaries)!\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Mistakes with Strings**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings have such a wide definition, that it is easy to make mistakes when working with them. Here are some things to watch out for:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not enclosing them in single quotes (e.g. `'Hello'`) or double quotes (e.g. `\"World\"`)\n",
        "2. Although Python treats single and double quotes the same, you *cannot* combine the two (e.g. do NOT do `\"Hello, World!'`)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Quotes in Strings\n",
        "\n",
        "You are still allowed to mix double quotes and single quotes. As long as you enclose each pair of quotes, they can in fact be very useful to use together - such as when a string includes a quote!\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what NOT to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(\"I said \"hello.\"\")  # ERROR!\n",
        "```\n",
        "In the above code snippet, the `'hello'` ends up not being enclosed by any pair of quotes. \n",
        "\n",
        "So how to remedy this? One option is to enclose the whole string in a pair of *single quotes*, so we can let the *double quotes* in the sentence enclose the `'hello'` properly:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print('I said \"hello.\"')  # all good :)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, let's take a look at the Boolean data type!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Boolean Types\n",
        "The Boolean data type, represented as `bool` in Python, needs no overthinking - it simply represents whether `True` or `False`. \n",
        "\n",
        "As you might imagine, they are especially useful for writing code that answers yes/no questions - we will discuss this more in-depth when we talk about [Control Flow](#control-flow).\n",
        "\n",
        "### The `str()`, `int()`, and `float()` Functions\n",
        "Python's data types are not necessarily set in stone. In some scenarios (shown below) we can convert, or *cast*, a given value in one data type to another, by calling the desired data type like a function! More technically, this is also called *explicit type conversion*.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variables\n",
        "The data in our program can change not only in its **type**. In addition, it is even more common for our data to change in its **value**. A *variable* in programming is how we represent some piece of data whose value can be many different things. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It can be only one word.\n",
        "2. It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (`_`) character.\n",
        "3. It can’t begin with a number.\n",
        "4. Variable name starting with an underscore (`_`) are considered as \"unuseful`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Augmented Assignment Operators\n",
        "Python provides additional operators that provide us with a shorthand for when we are updating the value inside a variable. Table 8 describes these:\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Table 8: Augmented Assignment Operators (and the Equivalent Statements)\n",
        "| Operator    | Equivalent        |\n",
        "| ----------- | ----------------- |\n",

        "| `spam /= 1` | `spam = spam / 1` |\n",
        "| `spam %= 1` | `spam = spam % 1` |\n",
        "\n",
        "## Control Flow\n",
        "While knowing how to store data is nice, it is even cooler to be able to write programs that can let the computer do certain tasks for us.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Control flow* refers to how the computer figures out what to do with our data in a given situation. This is most often done through giving the computer specific conditions on what to do in a given scenario ahead of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you might decide whether to wear sunglasses or not, based on if the sun is shining. If we were to write *pseudocode* for this decision, it might look like the following:\n",

        "if it's sunny outside,\n",
        "    THEN, I will wear_sunglasses()!\n",

        "All the variables in a Python program have a *scope*. *Scope* is how we describe the place in a program where we can actually access the value of a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "To start off with, let's discuss the **2 main scopes in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. *Local*: we say all the variables *inside* of a function have a *local* scope - meaning, they can be only be accessed within the function body.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *Global*: these are all the variables outside of any function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rules of Thumb For Scope:\n",
        "Here are some basic rules to remember, so you never run into issues with scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The code in the global scope cannot use any local variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. However, a variable in a local scope can access global variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The code in a function’s local scope cannot use variables in any other function.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. You *can* use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. That is, there can be a local variable named `spam` and a global variable also named `spam`. \n",
        "\n",
        "### What Scope Does This Variable Have?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. If the variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all functions), then it is always a global variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, then it is a global variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, then it is a local variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. However, if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, then it is a global variable.\n",
